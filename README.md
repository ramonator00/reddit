# Getting Started
A `.env` file must be created under `src`.
The following environment variables are needed for this:

```
[Credentials]
username=<USERNAME>
password=<PASSWORD>
client_id=<CLIENT_ID>
secret_token=<SECRET TOKEN>
proxy=<PROXY>
header_info=<HEADER INFO>

```
If no proxy has to be used, the environment variable can be set to `None`.
